# Flask App - DevOps Project Template

This repository serves as a template for a simple Flask-based DevOps project. The app provides basic calculator functionalities (addition and subtraction) and includes all necessary files for setting up a local environment, running tests, and deploying to a cloud service with best practices in DevOps.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
DEVOPS-PROJECT/
├── app.py
├── utils.py
├── test.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Makefile
├── templates/
│   └── home.html
├── .env
├── .gitignore
```

### File Descriptions

- **`app.py`**: The main application file for the Flask app. It sets up routes and connects them to functions in `utils.py` to provide API endpoints for app operations.

- **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions for core operations like addition and subtraction. This file is designed to house the main logic for the app’s functionality.

- **`test.py`**: A unit test file that includes tests for the functions defined in `utils.py`. This file ensures that the core functionality behaves as expected.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies needed to run the application. This file is used to install the necessary packages in the project environment.

- **`Makefile`**: A makefile to streamline project setup and operations. Includes commands for:
  - `make init`: Install project dependencies.
  - `make run`: Start the Flask app.
  - `make test`: Run all unit tests.

- **`templates/home.html`**: HTML template for the app's user interface. This file provides input fields and buttons for interacting with the calculator operations.

- **`.env`**: A configuration file for environment variables. It’s used to securely store sensitive information (like API keys, database credentials, or environment-specific settings). **Note**: This file should not be committed to version control for security reasons.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git. It typically includes files such as `.env` and compiled Python files (`__pycache__`), as well as local environment and dependency caches.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DEVOPS-PROJECT
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended for managing dependencies).
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     make init
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Flask app locally:
     ```bash
     make run
     ```


4. **Run Tests**:
   - Execute unit tests to verify functionality:
     ```bash
     make test
     ```

## Additional Configuration

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Use the `.env` file to store any environment-specific configurations or sensitive information. Be sure to keep this file out of version control by listing it in `.gitignore`.

## Deployment Instructions

For deployment, configure CI/CD pipelines according to your preferred platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines). This template can be used with cloud deployment platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku for easy scalability.
  - Use `pipeline.yaml` as a template for a pipeline to build and deploy an application on Azure
